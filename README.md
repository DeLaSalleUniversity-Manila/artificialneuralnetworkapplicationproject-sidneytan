{Is +/- P 5 difference insignificant?} - mkc


**_update_**

{Sir, the question was updated to +/- 0.5 php difference, as  we clarified with you using our correlation graphs that we are producing an average deviation of +/- 0.5 php from the actual value. So the question now would be if **0.5 php difference is insignificant**} -Zarzoso, Antonio

Yes, 0.5 Php is insignificant as it is less than Patel's minimum requirement stated in the book "Stock Futures: Strategies for Profiting from Stock Futures" it says that, ** "How much of my total equity should I be willing to risk? Most experts would advise anything from 0.5 - 5% of your total equity per trade"** Further explanations on this can be found within our paper under **Notice/Update** section. - group
